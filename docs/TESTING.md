## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

### Functional Tests (Playwright)
```bash
# All functional tests
mvn test -Dtest=**/functional/**/*Test

# Success scenarios only (implemented)
mvn test -Dtest=**/functional/success/*Test

# Individual test classes
mvn test -Dtest=CustomerManagementSuccessTest
mvn test -Dtest=AccountOpeningSuccessTest
mvn test -Dtest=TransactionSuccessTest
```

### Enhanced Debugging Options
```bash
# Basic debugging - visible browser with slow motion
mvn test -Dtest=CustomerManagementSuccessTest -Dplaywright.headless=false -Dplaywright.slowmo=500

# Full debugging - visible + recording + slow motion
mvn test -Dtest=TransactionSuccessTest -Dplaywright.headless=false -Dplaywright.slowmo=1000 -Dplaywright.record=true

# Cross-browser testing
mvn test -Dtest=**/functional/success/*Test -Dplaywright.browser=firefox
mvn test -Dtest=**/functional/success/*Test -Dplaywright.browser=webkit

# CI-friendly with recording
mvn test -Dtest=**/functional/**/*Test -Dplaywright.record=true
```

### Coverage Report
```bash
mvn test jacoco:report
# View: target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Test Configuration

### Browser Options
- **Default**: Headless Chromium
- **Browser**: `-Dplaywright.browser=firefox|webkit|chromium`
- **Headless**: `-Dplaywright.headless=false`
- **Recording**: `-Dplaywright.record=true` → `target/playwright-recordings/`
- **Slow Motion**: `-Dplaywright.slowmo=500` (milliseconds between actions)
- **Recording Directory**: `-Dplaywright.record.dir=custom/path`

### Recording Setup ✅ Working
Recording functionality is fully operational. Videos are automatically saved to `target/playwright-recordings/` with unique filenames.

**Quick Recording Test:**
```bash
# Test recording (confirmed working)
mvn test -Dtest=CustomerManagementSuccessTest#shouldDisplayCustomerListElementsSuccessfully -Dplaywright.record=true

# Check recordings created
ls -la target/playwright-recordings/
```

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
📁 Recording directory created/verified: /path/to/target/playwright-recordings
🎥 Video recording enabled - Directory: /path | Mode: retain-on-failure
🎥 Video saved to: /path/to/video-file.webm
✅ Video recording confirmed: /path (size: XXXX bytes)
```

**Video Details:**
- **Format**: WebM (`.webm` files)
- **Naming**: Unique hash-based filenames (e.g., `5378010d93dd466606f305418d7388ab.webm`)
- **Size**: Typically 200-500KB for short tests
- **Playback**: Chrome, Firefox, VLC, or any WebM-compatible player

**Best Recording Practices:**
```bash
# Visible browser with slow motion for clear recording
mvn test -Dtest=YourTest -Dplaywright.record=true -Dplaywright.headless=false -Dplaywright.slowmo=1000

# Custom recording directory
mvn test -Dtest=YourTest -Dplaywright.record=true -Dplaywright.record.dir=recordings/debug

# Batch recording for multiple tests
mvn test -Dtest=**/functional/success/*Test -Dplaywright.record=true
```

## Implementation Progress & Roadmap

## Test Data Management

### CSV Fixtures (Implemented & Enhanced)
```
src/test/resources/fixtures/functional/
├── personal-customer-creation-success.csv    # Personal customer data (separated)
├── corporate-customer-creation-success.csv   # Corporate customer data (separated)
├── customer-search-success.csv
├── account-opening-success.csv
├── transaction-deposit-success.csv
└── transaction-withdrawal-success.csv
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **Separated Customer Types**: Personal and corporate customers now have distinct CSV files with appropriate field structures
- ✅ **Field Alignment**: CSV headers perfectly match form fields to prevent parameter shifting
- ✅ **Unique Test Data**: All tests use timestamp-based unique identifiers to avoid conflicts

### Seed Data Integration
Tests use actual seed data from Flyway migrations:
- Islamic banking products (TAB001, TAB002, DEP001, PEM001, PEM002)
- Sample customers (C1000001, C1000002, C1000003)
- RBAC users with different roles (admin, manager1-2, teller1-3, cs1-3)
- 29 granular permissions across 9 categories

## Best Practices

### Functional Testing
1. **ID-based Selectors**: Always use element IDs for stability
2. **Localization-safe Assertions**: Use URL patterns and element visibility, not text content
3. **Page Object Model**: Maintain clear separation between test logic and page interactions
4. **Data-driven Testing**: Use CSV fixtures for comprehensive scenario coverage
5. **Cross-browser Testing**: Regularly validate against Firefox and WebKit engines

### Test Development
1. **Success First**: Implement happy path scenarios before error cases
2. **Independent Tests**: Each test should be self-contained and not depend on others
3. **Proper Waits**: Use Playwright's built-in wait conditions, never sleep()
4. **Video Recording**: Enable for debugging complex test failures
5. **Database Integration**: Use TestContainers for isolated, realistic testing
